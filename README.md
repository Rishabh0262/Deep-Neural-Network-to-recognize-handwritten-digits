# Deep-Neural-Network-to-recognize-handwritten-digits

This is the first project I made with the help of Coursera's course "Introduction to AI, DL and ML.

Here, I am creating a basic computer vision scenario using TensorFlow to recognize handwritten digits! 
The classificaiton using MNIST(a data set which has items of handwriting, 
dataset called MNIST -- the digits 0 through 9.)
